## ?? Your First Agent Session (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your Starting Point

Based on your current state with Project Aegis, here are recommended starting points:

**If you need to:**
- **Plan & Strategize** ? Start with Market Analysis
- **Research Options** ? Start with Competitor Analysis  
- **Create Proposals** ? Start with Investor Pitch Deck
- **Build Sales** ? Start with Sales Playbook
- **Design Systems** ? Start with System Architecture

### Step 2: Open Relevant Files

Before your first prompt, open files that provide context:
- `docs/utility-damage-prevention-ml-guide.md` (your ML guide)
- `src/Index.js` (your current API)
- `README.md` (project overview)

### Step 3: Craft Your First Prompt

Use this template:

```
I'm building Project Aegis - a SaaS product for utility damage prevention 
using ML. I have:
- ML guide: docs/utility-damage-prevention-ml-guide.md
- Current API: src/Index.js

I need to [YOUR GOAL: e.g., create a market analysis, design architecture, etc.]

Please create [SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE] that includes [KEY REQUIREMENTS].
```

### Step 4: Iterate

Review the output and refine:
- "Add more detail on [topic]"
- "Include [specific element]"
- "Adjust for [constraint]"

## ?? Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Build Sequentially
Each phase builds on the previous one. Complete planning before architecture.

### 2. Reference Previous Work
Always reference earlier documents:
```
"Based on the market analysis you created earlier, 
design the pricing strategy..."
```

### 3. Be Specific
Include constraints and requirements:
```
"Design for AWS, handle 1000 req/min, 99.9% uptime, 
cost-optimized for startup"
```

### 4. Iterate and Refine
Don't expect perfect output on first try:
```
Round 1: Initial draft
Round 2: Add details
Round 3: Optimize
```

### 5. Validate Outputs
Always review agent-generated code/docs:
- Test code
- Verify calculations
- Check references
- Validate assumptions

Reference my ML guide and include market opportunity, 
solution overview, business model, and financial projections."
```

### Use Case 2: Customer Proposal
```
Prompt: "Create a customer proposal template for Project Aegis 
targeting utility companies. Include ROI calculator and 
implementation timeline."
```

### Use Case 3: Production Architecture
```
Prompt: "Design production system architecture for Project Aegis.

## ?? Iterative Development Pattern

Use this pattern for complex deliverables:

```
Session 1: "Create initial [DELIVERABLE]"
  ? Review
Session 2: "Refine based on [FEEDBACK]"
  ? Review  
Session 3: "Add [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS]"
  ? Review
Session 4: "Optimize for [METRICS]"
  ? Finalize
```
